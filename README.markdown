## OBJECTIVE
Using the "Pride and Prejudice" book as the input file, I executed mapper reducer functionality using python to represent the Hadoop infrastructure. I also defined and used multi-threading to simultaneously execute operations of two mapper and reducer functions.

## TECHNOLOGIES
Project is created with:

Python (Threading and Queue)
PySpark

## DATA
![GitHub Logo](/Images/input.JPG)

## IMPLEMENTATION
We define functions to perform all the transformations of the data and call them in the end just like how Scala works. Multithreading in Python is an amazing functionality to mirror what happens in Spark when you execute a command.
